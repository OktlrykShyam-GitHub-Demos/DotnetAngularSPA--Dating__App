# ASP.Net Core SPA Web API + Angular Demo

## Dating App

This is a demo app featuring a Full Stack Dotnet Web API + Angular framework. It's derived from Coursework on Udemy. I really think it is a suitable demonstration of Web Developer skills as it covers frontend backend and various issues like jwt, pagination, seeding and so on.

It is simple, has enough demonstrative qualities and is a good benchmark for describing intermediate skills in the above technologies.

*Dockerfiles included*

note:
docker-compose includes a mysql5 container. Else you could just run the dev version with dotnet run - sqlite dev support included.
